PHOTO OF VENUE HERE

I am currently a developer at YLD and even before I joined me and Greta , who is the marketing manager at the same company, had talked about making a react conference because we both like that kind of environment and it’s a really good way of giving back to the community and of course bring awesome people to London.

We honestly thought this was a Greta idea and that the hardest part of running a conference would be getting speakers … This is the story of why we were so wrong and if you value sleep you should not organize a conference.

### Getting Speakers

  

This was the first thing we thought about because who needs a venue when you have people right ?! LOL

First two people that were automatically drafted without a real choice was me and [Eli](https://twitter.com/elibelly) because we were both very active in the London meetup community and we also had both spoken at several events.

Also we are friends with Greta so…

After that we went to find some awesome speakers and agreed on talking to some such as [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), [Kitze](https://twitter.com/thekitze), [Siddharth Kshetrapal](https://twitter.com/siddharthkp), [Sarah Drasner](http://twitter.com/sarah_edo) and [Peggy Rayzis](https://twitter.com/peggyrayzis).

Sarah was in Iceland at the time so that was no go, Dan was the sweetest person and said he would prefer to wait a bit to see if we had diversity before agreeing on anything and the other three were on board. Since we did have diversity Dan agreed to be on of the speakers and we already had 6 speakers and a pretty good lineup right ?

### Venue

  

People are hard ! So Greta actually organized all this part and we had this really weird venue in Camden that was actually a strip club by night and I am not really sure why we agreed on this but luckily the venue people had some problems and forced us to switch venues.

They sent us to one that was a Cabaret by night and that was slightly better right ? Maybe ? Well we were pretty much stuck because they did this like 3 weeks before it actually happened, the good news is that venue turned out awesome and they really pulled it off , we even got invited to a cabaret show , the bad news is that me and greta almost had a mental breakdown and did the whole conference in the park.
