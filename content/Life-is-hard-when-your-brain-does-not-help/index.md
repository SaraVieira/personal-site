I think itâ€™s important to get some back story first before we dive into the fears and weirdness of the mind. Because you know? Buy me dinner first, right?Â 

**HelloÂ ! ðŸ‘‹**

My name is Sara, I am a 25 year old Front End Developer based out of Portugal. I love my job, I have done several conferences and wrote a couple of articles but always about tech, never about myself so this feels kind of weird. I am also gay and you may ask: why did I need to know that?Â 

Well because being gay worsens your anxiety problems mainly because you always slightly leave in fear that people will reject you.

Also my family has a history of depression and panic attacks way before I was even planned so I was kind of doomed in that whole brain scenarioÂ 

### WTF happened SaraÂ ?

  

I want to start by saying that the last time I felt like myself before I started treatment was when I was 19. I remember that like it was yesterday and yet I see it all in a blur. I remember that I wasnâ€™t scared and that I was happy with whatever I had, I remember that I wasnâ€™t broken. I donâ€™t think you ever actually appreciate these feelings until you loose them.Â 

When I was about 20 years old I had a panic attack, I know know it was a psicose because it altered the chemicals in my brain.Â 

After that night I was never the same. I was afraid of everything, I would have panic and anxiety attacks on the randomness occasions like when I was cooking and I never felt safe anywhere.Â 

> If you donâ€™t know how an anxiety attacks work imagine you are tilting on a chair and there is that moment before you fall where you know you are gonna fall and everything feels just weird. Well itâ€™s like that! Except all the damn time!Â 

I remember that back then I was in school, I had night classes and that was the only time I left the house. I only left it to go to class because as soon as I would leave my legs would start shaking and my heart would race and I couldnâ€™t concentrate or even stay up in the same spot for very long. Things got better at night, I could hang out with friends and even go to get coffee. I also never had a panic attack in my car, weirdly enough in the place where I was most likely to have an accident I felt safe.

I didnâ€™t know what I had, all of these was completely new to me, I just decided to ignore and power through it because I thought that all if this was just a fleeting thing, underestimated the power of my fucked up brain and just did nothing. **Doing nothing in this is the worst you can do.Â **

I stayed like this for like a year without telling anyoneâ€¦Â 

One day I just realised I couldnâ€™t live my life like this, I had stopped drinking because I was afraid of losing control and stopped anything that involved a crowd because I just couldnâ€™t stay there.Â 

I talked to my mom and slowly told my friends that weâ€™re very supportive and eventually somewhat fixed the problem, I started going out more but I never went to clubs and felt comfortable again, ever drank a beer again and never went to the mall with shaking at least half the time. I wasnâ€™t the same person, I was a mini version of me, a broken one.Â 

Sometimes it was better sometimes it was worse but I was living like this for so long that I didnâ€™t question it anymore, it was just my life.

I think one of the worst parts of mental health is that when you are in too deep you think that you are always gonna be like that, that you just canâ€™t be like other people and you feel like you need to accept that. Like there is no other way and you gotta play with the hand you are given mainly because you arenâ€™t strong enough to fight back.

You also donâ€™t remember anything before that because you are so deep that every glimpse of hope disappears and in reality you donâ€™t want it, because in your mind its better to not see it because inside yourself you know you are not getting better no matter how many times people tell you will.

While this whole thing was happening I was giving some conferences and doing my absolute best to not let it show. Every time I was speaking at a conference I honestly felt like I was going to faint at any moment, I just wanted it to be over and that no one noticed just how messed up I was.Â 

### Fast forward to lastÂ year

  

Mid last year I got an awesome job at an amazing company but this job came with more stress than I was used to and literally more stress than my body could handle.Â 

I started feeling worse everyday, there was a point where I had to go to the bathroom like 4 times a day just to wait the anxiety through because I couldnâ€™t concentrate. I kept shaking and every time someone called me to their seat it was a nightmare to me to do such a simple thing because my legs were always shaking so much that it was really hard to walk straight.Â 

I didnâ€™t do anything, since the beginning I always had worse periods so I assumed it was a bad one and that it would pass but it never did, it only got worse and this started to happening everyday.Â 

It got so bad that I had to move back with my mom because I didnâ€™t feel safe anywhere.Â 

I remember that one day I went grocery shopping with my mom and we went to get something from a store nearby and when I was walking to the supermarket I couldnâ€™t walk anymore. My body literally wasnâ€™t responding and I really felt like fainting. I had this fainting sensation a lot of times but I could sense this one was going to be the start of something horrible.Â 

Next day I went to work because Iâ€™m not the smartest tool in the branch, as soon as I sat down I had a huge panic attack and only had time to reach my product owner before I fainted.Â 

> My body had reached the breaking point

I went home and the next day I found it really hard to do anything, it took me 5 m to get to my room to the bathroom because I felt so weak no matter how much I ate.

I was just doing nothing because I literally could not walk without my mother helping me, I honestly felt so powerless in my whole life.

My mother forced me to go to the therapist but all I wanted to do was go to the hospital, I felt like I was fading away and this could not be happening only in my brain.
