A little backstory first so you know the point of this. My name is Sara, I am 23yr old Front-end Developer from Portugal and this past year was the first year I worked in a team and in this team all people were older than, some by 2 years and some by 10 years and I had huge misconceptions about “adults” and I think I am not the only one seeing things this way.

#### No one is really an adult

The main thing I learned besides doing my taxes is that in reality no one is an adult, you just learn to fake it a little better. The reality is that no one really knows what they are doing.

I watched married people with kids go to rock clubs with me until 4am, people falling asleep and showing up for work at midday because they thought they were on vacations and 30yr olds leave places with me at 7am when they had shit to do in the morning.

There is not an age when you become an adult, that solely depends on your responsibilities and how you choose to decide your life.

#### Grown ups exercise

I was shocked about this, me as a human being hate exercising I get no pleasure from doing it and my body cries so I never attempted to join a gym because I know myself and most my friends are this way so it really shocking to me that more than 50% of people in that workplace, and take in mind that it’s an IT office, either are at a gym or do some sort of aggressive physical exercise like cycling or running.

I am not telling you to start exercising because I sure as hell didn’t join a gym, I am just letting you know that this is a thing.

#### You are (probably) not an alcoholic

I don’t drink alcohol, a couple of years ago I made the conscious decision to stop drinking and it was always an awkward thing to explain to people on weekends when I went out with my friends and they drank but at least I only had to say it on weekends, right?

Wrong ! Drink one or two beers a day is completely normal as I found out with time and also as I started to explain why I don’t drink every day.
